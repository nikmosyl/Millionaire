This app is the result of creativity and passion from the **[Devrush Swift Marathon XV](https://devrush.ru/swiftmarathon)**. We poured our hearts into crafting a fun and engaging quiz experience inspired by the classic "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" game show.

We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed building it!
